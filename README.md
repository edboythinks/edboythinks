I'm Dan.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I can about Python! Soon, I hope to pick up a C language (probably C++) and eventually Rust.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on applications implementing data handling scripts in Python, possibly also applications that implement the pyqt module.

- âš¡ Fun fact: All of my development is done on a Linux machine. I have a great appreciation for the kernel itself and its extensibility with all of the various toolsets it uses.
